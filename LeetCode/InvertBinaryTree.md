#### Trivia:
This problem was inspired by this original tweet by Max Howell:
> Google: 90% of our engineers use the software you wrote (Homebrew), but you canâ€™t invert a binary tree on a whiteboard so fuck off.

# Code

```c++

/**
 * Definition for a binary tree node.
 * struct TreeNode {
 *     int val;
 *     TreeNode *left;
 *     TreeNode *right;
 *     TreeNode(int x) : val(x), left(NULL), right(NULL) {}
 * };
 */
class Solution {
public:
    TreeNode* invertTree(TreeNode* root) {
        if (!root) return NULL;
        TreeNode *temp = root->left;
        root->left = invertTree(root->right);
        root->right = invertTree(temp);
        return root;
    }
};


```
