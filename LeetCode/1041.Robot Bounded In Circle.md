# 1041.Robot Bounded In Circle



On an infinite plane, a robot initially stands at `(0, 0)` and faces north. The robot can receive one of three instructions:

- `"G"`: go straight 1 unit;
- `"L"`: turn 90 degrees to the left;
- `"R"`: turn 90 degress to the right.

The robot performs the `instructions` given in order, and repeats them forever.

Return `true` if and only if there exists a circle in the plane such that the robot never leaves the circle.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: "GGLLGG"
Output: true
Explanation: 
The robot moves from (0,0) to (0,2), turns 180 degrees, and then returns to (0,0).
When repeating these instructions, the robot remains in the circle of radius 2 centered at the origin.
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: "GG"
Output: false
Explanation: 
The robot moves north indefinitely.
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: "GL"
Output: true
Explanation: 
The robot moves from (0, 0) -> (0, 1) -> (-1, 1) -> (-1, 0) -> (0, 0) -> ...
```

**Hint**

Calculate the final vector of how the robot travels after executing all instructions once - it consists of a change in position plus a change in direction.

The robot stays in the circle iff (looking at the final vector) it changes direction (ie. doesn't stay pointing north), or it moves 0.

**Solution**

```swift
func isRobotBounded(_ instructions: String) -> Bool {
    // North = 0, East = 1, South = 2, West = 3
    let directions = [[0, 1], [1, 0], [0, -1], [-1, 0]]
    
    var idx = 0 // Currently at north
    var x = 0 // Starting points
    var y = 0
    
    for c in instructions {
        switch c {
        case "L":
            // Turn left
            idx = (idx + 3) % 4
            break
        case "R":
            // Turn right
            idx = (idx + 1) % 4
            break
        default:
            // Go forward
            x += directions[idx][0]
            y += directions[idx][1]
            break
        }
    }
    
    return ((x == 0 && y == 0) || (idx != 0))
}
```
