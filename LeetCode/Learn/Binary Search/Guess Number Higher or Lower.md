We are playing the Guess Game. The game is as follows:

I pick a number from `1` to `n`. You have to guess which number I picked.

Every time you guess wrong, I will tell you whether the number I picked is higher or lower than your guess.

You call a pre-defined API `int guess(int num)`, which returns 3 possible results:

- `-1`: The number I picked is lower than your guess (i.e. `pick < num`).
- `1`: The number I picked is higher than your guess (i.e. `pick > num`).
- `0`: The number I picked is equal to your guess (i.e. `pick == num`).

Return *the number that I picked*.

 

**Example 1:**

```
Input: n = 10, pick = 6
Output: 6
```

**Example 2:**

```
Input: n = 1, pick = 1
Output: 1
```

**Example 3:**

```
Input: n = 2, pick = 1
Output: 1
```

**Example 4:**

```
Input: n = 2, pick = 2
Output: 2
```

 

**Solution**

```swift
/** 
 * Forward declaration of guess API.
 * @param  num -> your guess number
 * @return 	     -1 if the picked number is lower than your guess number
 *			      1 if the picked number is higher than your guess number
 *               otherwise return 0
 * func guess(_ num: Int) -> Int 
 */

class Solution : GuessGame {

func guessNumber(_ n: Int) -> Int {
    var low = 1
    var high = n
    while low <= high {
        let mid = low + (high - low) / 2
        let res = guess(mid)
        if res == 0 {
            return mid
        } else if res == 1 {
            low = mid + 1
        } else {
            high = mid - 1
        }
    }
    return -1
}

}
```
